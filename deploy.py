# Example: model deployment script (deploy.py)
import joblib

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('trained_model.joblib')  # Replace with the trained model filename

# Deploy the model to the desired environment (e.g., Flask app, API endpoint, etc.)
# Example: Start a Flask server or deploy to a cloud service
# Ensure to handle model serving and input/output accordingly based on deployment needs
